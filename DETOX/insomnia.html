  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>Insomnia is a type of sleep disorder. Individuals with insomnia find it difficult to fall asleep, stay asleep, or both.

    People with insomnia often don’t feel refreshed when they wake up from sleeping, either. This can lead to fatigue and other symptoms.
    
    Insomnia is the most common of all sleep disorders, according to the American Psychiatric Association (APA).
    
    In fact, the APA states that PREVENTION one-third of all adults report insomnia symptoms. Between 6 to 10 percent of all adults have symptoms severe enough for them to be diagnosed with insomnia disorder.
    
    The APA defines insomnia as a disorder in which people have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Doctors make a clinical diagnosis of insomnia if both of these criteria apply:
             ⇨ Sleep difficulties occurring at least three nights a week for a minimum of 3 months.
             ⇨ Sleep difficulties creating major distress or functional difficulties in a person’s life.</pre>
