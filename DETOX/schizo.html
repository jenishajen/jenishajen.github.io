  Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally.
  Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely
  disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.

People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms
under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.</pre>

  <h2>CAUSES</h2>
  <p >
    <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    It's not known what causes schizophrenia, but researchers believe that a combination of genetics,
	brain chemistry and environment contributes to development of the disorder.

Problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters called
dopamine and glutamate, may contribute to schizophrenia. Neuroimaging studies show differences
in the brain structure and central nervous system of people with schizophrenia. While researchers
aren't certain about the significance of these changes, they indicate that schizophrenia is a
brain disease.</pre>

<div id="SYMPTOMS" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    Symptoms may include:

⇨Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're
being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional
ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur.
Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.

⇨Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person
with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be
in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.

⇨Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective
communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely,
speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.

⇨Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike
silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior
can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or
useless and excessive movement.

⇨Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may
neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions
or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack
the ability to experience pleasure

Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult
to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are
common for typical development during teen years, such as:

      ⇨Withdrawal from friends and family
      ⇨A drop in performance at school
      ⇨Trouble sleeping
      ⇨Irritability or depressed mood
      ⇨Lack of motivation</pre>

<div id="PREVENTION" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
      ⇨Seek early treatment (to control symptoms before complication develop and to improve long
	  term outlook)
      ⇨Stick to treatment plan(to prevent relapses or worsenning of schizophrenia symptoms)
      ⇨Learn about risk factors may lead to earlier diagnosis and earlier treatmentAvoid illegal
	  drug and alcohol use
      ⇨Reducing stress
