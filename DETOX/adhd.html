  Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that
  includes a combination of persistent problems, such as difficulty paying attention,
  hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
  affects about 5 percent of children, and about half of them will carry those symptoms
  into adulthood, says the American Psychiatric Association. The Centers for Disease Control
  and Prevention estimate that numbers are even higher in smaller community samples. On top
  of that, many adults with ADHD have never been diagnosed.

Untreated ADHD can cause numerous mental and physical problems that can put a strain on
relationships and cause difficulties in many aspects of everyday life. It’s important to
recognize the signs of adult ADHD so you can get proper treatment. Keep reading to learn
about the symptoms.</pre>

  <h2>CAUSES</h2>
  <p >
    <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    While the exact cause of ADHD is not clear, research efforts continue. Factors that
	may be involved in the development of ADHD include:

       ⇨Genetics. ADHD can run in families, and studies indicate that genes may play a role.
       ⇨Environment. Certain environmental factors also may increase risk, such as lead
	   exposure as a child.
       ⇨Problems during development. Problems with the central nervous system at key moments
	   in development may play a role.s</pre>

  <h5>Time management tips</h5>
         ⇨Adults with attention deficit disorder often have a different
		 perception of how time passes. To align your sense of time with
		 everyone else, use the oldesttrick in the book: a clock.

         ⇨Become a clock-watcher. Use a wristwatch or highly visible
		 wall or desk clock to help you keep track of time. When you start
		 a task, make a note of the time by saying it out loud or writing
		 it down.

         ⇨Use timers. Allot yourself limited amounts of time for each task
		 and use a timer or alarm to alert you when your time is up. For
		 longer tasks, consider setting an alarm to go off at regular
		 intervals to keep you productive and aware of how much time is
		 going by.

         ⇨Give yourself more time than you think you need. Adults with ADHD
		 are notoriously bad at estimating how long it will take to do something.
		 For every thirty minutes of time you think it will take you to get
		 someplace or complete a task, give yourself a cushion by adding ten
		 minutes.

         ⇨Plan to be early and set up reminders. Write down appointments for
		 fifteen minutes earlier than they really are. Set up reminders to
		 ensure you leave on time and make sure you have everything you need
		 ahead of time so you’re not frantically looking for your keys or phone
		 when it’s time to go.

  <h5>Prioritization tips</h5>
      Because adults with ADHD often struggle with impulse control and jump from
	  one subject to another, completing tasks can be difficult and large projects
	  can seem overwhelming.
	  To overcome this:

         ⇨Decide what to tackle first. Ask yourself what the most important task
		 is that you need to accomplish, and then order your other priorities
		 after that one.

         ⇨Take things one at a time. Break down large projects or jobs into
		 smaller, manageable steps.

         ⇨Stay on task. Avoid getting sidetracked by sticking to your schedule,
		 using a timer to enforce it if necessary.</pre></p>
