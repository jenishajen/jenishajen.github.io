  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <img src='https://www.eurekaselect.com/images/graphical-abstract/cwhr/15/2/004.jpg'>
  <p >
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>People with BED may eat a lot of food in a short amount of time, even if they aren’t hungry.
  Emotional stress or destress often plays a role and might trigger a period of binge eating.

  A person might feel a sense of release or relief during a binge but experience feelings of
  shame or loss of control afterward.</pre>

<div id="CAUSES" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>CAUSES</h2>
  <p >
    <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    
        While the exact cause of BED is unknown, there are a variety of factors that are thought to influence the
		development of this disorder. These factors are:

        <h5>Biological:</h5>
		Biological abnormalities, such as hormonal irregularities or genetic mutations, may be associated
		with compulsive eating and food addiction.
        <h5>Psychological:</h5>
		A strong correlation has been established between depression and binge eating. Body dissatisfaction,
		low self-esteem, and difficulty coping with feelings can also contribute to binge eating disorder.
        <h5>Social and Cultural:</h5>
		Traumatic situations, such as a history of sexual abuse, can increase the risk of binge eating.
		Social pressures to be thin, which are typically influenced through media, can trigger emotional eating.
		Persons subject to critical comments about their bodies or weight may be especially vulnerable to binge eating disorder.</pre>

<div id="SYMPTOMS" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    For a healthcare professional to diagnose BED, three or more of the following symptoms must be
	present:

      ⇨eating much more rapidly than normal
      ⇨eating until uncomfortably full
      ⇨eating large amounts without feeling hungry
      ⇨eating alone due to feelings of embarrassment and shame
      ⇨feelings of guilt or disgust with oneself.</pre>
	 </p>
</div>

<div id="PREVENTION" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
      ⇨Go for a Walk
      ⇨Sleep It Off. Getting enough sleep after an episode of overeating is a good way to fight
	  off cravings and get the next day off on the right foot
      ⇨Eat a Healthy Breakfast
      ⇨Stay Hydrated
      ⇨Try Yoga
      ⇨Fill up on Veggies
      ⇨Avoid Skipping Meals
      ⇨Start Exercising</pre></p>
