  Drug addiction is a complex neurobiological disorder, which affects a person’s
  brain and behaviour in a way that they lose the ability to resist the urge to use drugs.

It isn’t just about illegal drugs like heroin and cocaine. You can get addicted to
substances like medication drugs, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana and other legal drugs as well.

Drug dependence usually starts with an experiment. Initially, you take drugs because
you like the way it feels. You think it’s a one-time experience and you can handle it.

Also, many people start using drugs as self-medication or to cope with stress.

But repeated misuse of drugs physically changes how your brain works. It makes you lose
self-control and messes with your ability to avoid the desire to take drugs. These
changes in the brain can be long-lasting.

People who are in recovery from drug abuse are likely to return to drug use even
after years of being in recovery from drug addiction. This is called drug relapse.</pre>

  <h2>CAUSES</h2>
  <p >
    <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    The reaction of drugs on a human mind varies widely from person to person.

Each person’s body and mind works differently. Some people love to use drugs,
and others hate it after their first try.

Rather than a single factor, multiple factors contribute to the addiction
to drugs.

⇨Genetics & Family History – Your genes may mean a greater predisposition
to addiction. Your body and brain react to a particular drug the way your
ancestors reacted to it. If your parents or their parents had a history with
drug abuse, your chances of being addicted to drugs increase drastically.

⇨Environmental Cause – Your environment also plays a vital role in developing
drug dependence. Because the environment influences behaviour, if a child grows
up in a home with a drug addict, it’s highly likely that he is going to struggle
with drugs too. Other environmental factors which can contribute to drug addiction
include the following –
    ⇨Abuse of drugs among friends and peers
    ⇨Lack of social support
    ⇨Troubled relationships
    ⇨Stress in life
    ⇨Low socioeconomic status
	
⇨Psychological Cause – Although genetics and environment play a significant role
in drug addiction, psychological factors also contribute to the problem. Sexual or
physical abuse, negligence from parents and peers, domestic violence, everything
can lead to psychological stress. And people turn to drugs to let off this stress.
Over time, this misuse of drugs can become an addiction.
⇨Other psychological causes
     ⇨Mental disorder such as depression
     ⇨Lack of friends in school or any social setting
     ⇨Huge academic pressure
     ⇨Traumatic events</pre>

<div id="SYMPTOMS" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    The signs and symptoms of drug addictions vary, and some drugs have a higher
	risk of getting addicted to them than others. Here are some of the symptoms
	of drug dependence:

        ⇨Feeling an intense urge to use drugs or medication frequently.
		Maybe several times a day.
        ⇨You need more substance to get the same effect because you built a
		tolerance for the drug.
        ⇨You feel alive when you are on the drug. When the drug wears off, you
		feel shaky, depressed, and confused. You may not feel hunger and may have
		headaches or run a fever.
        ⇨You can’t stop yourself from taking the drug.
        ⇨You are doing everything you can to make sure you get drug supplies, even
		if you can’t afford it.
        ⇨Your social life is a wreck. You have a hard time bonding with co-workers,
		friends or family.
        ⇨Your personal health declines. For example, you may start to gain or lose
		weight. You have bad breath or red eyes.
        ⇨You start to steal money to buy drugs.
        ⇨You experience withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking drugs.</pre>

<div id="PREVENTION" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
  When it comes to prevention from drug abuse, there is no foolproof way. But you
  can certainly do some things that will help you protect yourself and your loved ones
  from becoming addicted to drugs.

   ⇨Educate yourself – Learn about the physical, biological, and social effects of drug misuse.
    Evaluate the risk factors like losing a job, isolation from society, dropping out of college.
    No one sets out to be addicted to drugs, so be careful in thinking using a drug “just once”
    will not be harmful.
	
   ⇨Learn healthy ways to cope with stress – Stress is one of the primary reasons that drive
   people to drug misuse.
   
   ⇨In this fast-paced world, stress is inevitable – And sometimes to escape from stress,
   people turn to alcohol and drugs. In the end, this can make life more miserable and stressful.
   To avoid this, you should learn to handle stress without using drugs. Take up exercising, read
   a book, volunteer for a good cause, create something. Anything positive that will give you a
   sense of fulfillment and take your mind away from using drugs to relieve stress.
   
   ⇨Develop close bonds with family – Research has shown that people who have a close relationship
   with their families are less likely to abuse drugs. A loving family works as a support system
   and helps you deal with your pressures in life. It helps you to keep a distance from addictive
   substances.
   
   ⇨Choose your friends mindfully – Teenagers and young adults are easily influenced by others.
   Often they start to explore different addictive drugs to impress their friends and portray
   themselves as “cool”. Find friends who won’t force you to do harmful things or be okay with
   possibly facing rejection when you turn down drugs.
   
   ⇨Develop a healthy lifestyle – There is no better prevention of drug problems than adopting
   a healthy lifestyle. Being active and fit makes it easier to manage stress. This, in turn,
   helps to reduce the urge to use drugs or any other harmful substances to manage stress.
   ⇨These are some of the preventive measures one can take to avoid drug addiction. But if you
   already developed an addiction, it is advisable to seek professional help and treatment for
   your drug problem.</pre></p>
