  Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively
  affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable.
  Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed.
  It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to
  function at work and at home.</pre>

<div id="CAUSES" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>CAUSES</h2>
  <p >
    <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    Common causes include:

<h5>Family history.</h5> 
     ⇨You’re at a higher risk for developing depression if you have a family history of
	 depression or another mood disorder.
<h5>Early childhood trauma.</h5>
     ⇨Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and stressful situations.
<h5>Brain structure.</h5>
     ⇨There’s a greater risk for depression if the frontal lobe of your brain is less 
	 active. However,scientists don’t know if this happens before or after the onset of
	 depressive symptoms.
<h5>Medical conditions.</h5>
     ⇨Certain conditions may put you at higher risk, such as chronic illness, insomnia,
	 chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
<h5>Drug use.</h5>
     ⇨A history of drug or alcohol misuse can affect your risk.

About 21 percent of people who have a substance use problem also experience depression.
In addition to these causes, other risk factors for depression include:

     ⇨low self-esteem or being self-critical
     ⇨personal history of mental illness
     ⇨certain medications
     ⇨stressful events, such as loss of a loved one, economic problems, or a divorce

<div id="SYMPTOMS" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
    Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:

      ⇨Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
      ⇨Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
      ⇨Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
      ⇨Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
      ⇨Loss of energy or increased fatigue
      ⇨Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing,
	  handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough
	  to be observable by others)
      ⇨Feeling worthless or guilty
      ⇨Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
      ⇨Thoughts of death or suicide.</pre>

<div id="PREVENTION" class="tabcontent">
  <h2>PREVENTION</h2>
  <p>
  <pre style='font-size:25px;'>
 There’s no sure way to prevent depression. But you can:

     ⇨Find ways to handle stress and improve your self-esteem.
     ⇨Take good care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well, and exercise regularly.
     ⇨Reach out to family and friends when times get hard.
     ⇨Get regular medical checkups, and see your provider if you don’t feel right.
     ⇨Get help if you think you’re depressed. If you wait, it could get worse..</pre></p>
